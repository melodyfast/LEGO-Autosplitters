# LEGO-Autosplitters
Creating autosplitters for PC LEGO games in the livesplit ASL format.

LSW1 and TCS are currently finished with the exception of ending splits which will be added in later versions.

DCSV is currently finished but has not been tested, LTI is working but has an issue with time calculation that needs to be fixed.

Other scripts are currently in progress.
