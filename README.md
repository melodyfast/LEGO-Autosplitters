# LEGO-Autosplitters
Creating autosplitters and load removers for PC LEGO games in the livesplit ASL format.

LSW1, TCS, LIJ, and DCSV, and TSS are currently finished with the exception autosplitting for TSS.
(Credit goes to Zac and P53 for expanding on and fully updating my previous TCS autosplitter.)

LTI is working but has an issue with time calculation that needs to be fixed.

Current projects:
1. Autosplitting for TSS
